## Summary

This is the first iteration of my portfolio website. This is made entirely with HTML, CSS & vanilla JavaScript to highlight different projects I'm working on. Making this website was a huge learning opportunity as it allowed me to practice writing and refining different CSS techniques. Making this site with vanilla JS, HTML & CSS made me appreciate what you can accomplish with REACT, hence my second iteration ðŸ˜„
